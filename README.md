# Hello, World! üåê

My name is Matthew Pagan, and I'm a Rhode Island based Web Developer.

## My Stack, the JAMStack

- ReactJS
- GatsbyJS
- Material Design
- Vercel

## My Goal

My plan is to create a tutoring and web design business, based in Rhode Island.

### Local Entrepreneur and Small Business Web Applications

I will create websites based on the above stack of technologies for businesses in the Rhode Island area.

### Web Programming Tutoring for all ages

Creating web sites feels like I'm playing with the world's largest box of Legos. I absolutely cannot WAIT to meet the needs of the Rhode Island community with quality and maintainable code.

Using tools ranging from
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), to help expose children to the amazing, creative, and fun world of coding
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript, the basic building blocks of the web. This is the foundation for leveraging any frameworks to their maximum potential
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) a powerful, flexible, and honestly incredibly fun (this is where my Legos analogy plays in) library for painting your website on your canvas of code.
- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (from their site, "Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps")
- [Material Design](https://material.io/design/introduction#goals), to help make beautiful layouts and designs. To quote their website, "Material Design is a visual language that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation of technology and science."
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), "Develop. Preview. Ship." This is the tool that lets me make websites for my nieces and nephews for fun, because deployment is literally a click away from your code. 

### Doing Business with what I love

I spend a great amount of my free time self-studying web technologies. Because of this, I'm constantly absorbing new knowledge. It's never a question anymore of what I can and can't do. Now, new knowledge is only a few sessions of self-study away from practical business use (Shopify's [Storefront API](https://shopify.dev/docs/storefront-api) is an example of this, revolutionized my understanding of web e-commerce implenting it).

For me, creating usable and beautiful web apps is just plain fun. It's time I give back to the community, start a business, and add value to those around me.
