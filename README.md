## Rust PokeAPI Workspace

I created this [Rust Workspace](https://github.com/mastapegs/pokeapi-workspace) as a playground for me to build multiple libraries and binaries to accelerate my learning of Rust. Feel free to dive in if you'd like to see how a Rust Monorepo can be setup.

Here are the crates published within so far:

- [pokeapi_getters](https://crates.io/crates/pokeapi_getters)
- [pokeapi_types](https://crates.io/crates/pokeapi_types)
