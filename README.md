# Hello, World! üåê

My name is Matthew Pagan, and I'm a Rhode Island based Web Developer.

## My Stack, the JAMStack

- ReactJS
- GatsbyJS
- Vercel

## My Goal

My plan is to create a tutoring and web design business, based in Rhode Island.

### Local Entrepreneur and Small Business Web Applications

I will create websites based on the above stack of technologies for businesses in the Rhode Island area.

### Web Programming Tutoring for all ages

Creating web sites feels like I'm playing with the world's largest box of Legos. I absolutely cannot WAIT to meet the needs of the Rhode Island community with quality and maintainable code.

Using tools ranging from
- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) to help expose children to the amazing world of coding, to real web development working from basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) a powerful, flexible, and honestly incredibly fun (this is where my Legos analogy plays in) library for painting your website on your canvas of code.
- [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (from their site, "Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps")
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), "Develop. Preview. Ship." This is the tool that lets me make websites for my nieces and nephews for fun, because deployment is literally a click away from your code.
